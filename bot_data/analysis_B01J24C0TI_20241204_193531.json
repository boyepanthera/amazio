Also, honestly, and anyone can prove it just through everyday use, but the Echo is just not as useful as Google Assistant with inquiries. It works pretty well with home automation but it just doesn't understand or can't help with about half of the inquiries I throw at it. I would have gone with a Google Home if there was one with a touchscreen. I would recommend it for those heavily invested in Amazon Prime and home automation.",

      "review": "Alexa Show is really well put together. The main reason for my purchase was to create my own 'surveillance system' linking my Ring Doorbell, and Ring Floodlights to view on command by Alexa on the Show Screen. Yes, you can talk to it, and get results for almost any query, but with the show, you get a lot more. The touch screen is great for video calls, especially when you install the Alexa App on your family cell phones. Alexa can scan items via UPC and order them on Amazon, or tell you where to get them. The recipes you ask for are not only spoken to you, but SHOWN to you. Also, when music plays, you can see the lyrics on screen (If you use Amazon Music to play the music). You can ask for a news briefing, and you SEE the news, highlights, etc. The speakers aren't quite up to the same standard as the echo series, but it's close. The sound fills the room nicely. When the Echo Show is not being immediately used, the screen shows a picture of your choice, making it a digital frame too. Overall, the device is very nice, and they are constantly releasing new skills for Alexa to use, so it seems like there is always something new to wow you. Turning on and off lights, adjusting your thermostat, playing music, viewing security cameras are all just the standard duties, there is WAY more to do with this device!",

From my daily briefing in the morning, to tracking Santa with my 6 year old every morning learning interesting facts about Santa and several other things, I truly wish I would have bought this sooner. We have it integrated into our Cozi account so we can just ask Alexa to add items to various shopping lists instead of pulling out a phone and typing it in. We also have ADT Pulse and a Nest thermostat and the integration into those two platforms was so simple I couldn't believe it. My son loves to ask Alexa questions and in the mornings before school he is learning things instead of just watching a few minutes of a cartoon.Another highly used feature is the local forecast as my wife is a weather nut and always wants to know what the forecast for the area is. I am loving the Amazon Music now as well because we bought an Echo Dot just to integrate into our Bose whole house system so we can stream music all through the house now.If you are on the fence about getting the Echo Show like I was, just do it. It really is an amazing product!",

      "review": "I had reservations for the purchase of this Echo show, they quickly eroded after setting it up and using it now since Christmas day. Everyone in my family loves the camera function, sound quality, picture resolution and basically everything about it!It isn't totally perfected yet but it is a work in progress when it comes to the skills and how you choose to use this device since it is definitely designed for Amazon and their customers. Versatile enough so that everyone could find something to enjoy from music, pictures, videos to having your favorite book read to you. One of my favorite features are the Ole time radio series offered in the skills. Takes you back in time as you relax and very similar to a good book. Just my preference and it does offer much more and new skills are daily being added. Although we have several echo dots everywhere, my 6yo loves to come to the echo show to hear her music or to see new pictures uploaded to our cloud. The sound is amazing for its size, that's a huge plus. Pictures are dynamic and so far the only issue with me anyway is it's shape. Slightly odd but it seems to blend into our decor pretty well. Hopefully newer and even better skills will be made as this is a real gem in the rough with tons of applications still ahead that it can be used for. I have it connected to our home security system, robot vacuum cleaner and at times to my cell phone. Taken all together it is useful, fun and a nice addition for our gadget loaded home.",
